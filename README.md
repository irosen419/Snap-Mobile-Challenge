Hello and welcome to my CLI RPN Calculator!

To get started, while you are in the top level of this repository, run
  ``bundle install``
  ``ruby bin/run.rb``

After that, you will be able to type in your first input and use the calculator as you wish!

In creating this calculator, I initially decided to create a Calculartor class which is initialized at the start of the program. This allows for a new instance to be created each time the program is started. If this were something other than a simple calculator, this would allow us to save this instance for future reference.

The use of a switch/case was implemented to allow for easy addition of other operators in the future.

There are some bugs in the code that I would love to discuss, if given the opportunity. If I were on a team and could not find a solution via Google (as I could not here), my next step would be to ask for ideas within my team. Looking forward to our discussion!

Best,
Ian Rosen
